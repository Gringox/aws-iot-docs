# View MQTT messages with the AWS IoT MQTT client<a name="view-mqtt-messages"></a>

You can use the AWS IoT MQTT client in the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home) to watch the MQTT messages sent and received by AWS IoT\.

Devices publish MQTT messages on topics to communicate their state to AWS IoT, and AWS IoT publishes MQTT messages to inform the devices and apps of changes and events\. You can use the MQTT client to subscribe to these topics and watch these messages as they occur\. You can also use the MQTT client to publish MQTT messages to other devices and services in your AWS account\. 

## Viewing MQTT messages in the MQTT client<a name="view-mqtt-subscribe"></a>

**To view MQTT messages in the MQTT client**

1. In the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home), in the left navigation pane, choose **Test**\.

1. Subscribe to the topic on which your IoT thing publishes\. Continuing with this example, in **Subscribe to a topic**, in the **Subscription topic** field, enter **my/topic**, and then choose **Subscribe to topic**\.   
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/images/subscribe-button-topic.png)

   The **Publish** page opens and the **my/topic** topic appears in the **Subscriptions** column\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/images/subscribed-button-topic.png)

1. From the **Publish** page, you can publish messages to the subscribed topic and messages published to the subscribed topic appear below the message body window as they are received\.

**Troubleshooting**  
If your messages are not showing up as you expect, try subscribing to a wild card topic as described in [Topic filters](topics.md#topicfilters)\. For example, in the example shown here, you might subscribe to `my/#` to see messages sent to all topics that start with `my/`\. MQTT topics are case sensitive, so if your device is publishing messages to `my/Topic` instead of `my/topic`, to which you subscribed, its messages would not appear in the MQTT client\. With the wild card topic filter of `my/#`, you would see the message and the incorrect topic name used\. If that still doesn't work, you can subscribe to the `#` topic, which subscribes to every topic\.

## Publishing MQTT messages from the MQTT client<a name="view-mqtt-publish"></a>

**To publish a message to an MQTT topic**

1. On the MQTT client page, in the **Publish** section, in the **Specify a topic and a message to publish** field, enter the topic of your message\. In this example, use **my/topic**\. 
**Note**  
Do not use personally identifiable information in topic names whether you are using them in the MQTT client or in your system implementation\.

1. In the message body section, enter the following JSON:

   ```
   {
       "message": "Hello, world",
       "clientType": "MQTT client"
   }
   ```

1. Choose **Publish to topic** to publish your message to AWS IoT\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/images/publish-to-topic.png)

1. You should see the message in the AWS IoT MQTT client\. In the **Subscription** column, choose **my/topic** to see the message\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/images/publish-to-topic-received.png)

You can publish MQTT messages to other topics by changing the topic in the **Specify a topic and a message to publish** field and choosing the **Publish to topic** button\.

## More about MQTT messages<a name="view-mqtt-msg-details"></a>

The MQTT client displays only the message payload\. Other, lower\-level, information in the message is not available in the MQTT client\. Specialized software and hardware tools are available to view lower\-level message data and metadata\. The use of these tools, however, is beyond the scope of this documentation\.
