# Custom authorizers<a name="custom-authorizer"></a>

Custom authorizers consist of:

Name  
A unique arbitrary string that identifies the authorizer\.

Lambda function ARN  
An ARN of a Lambda function that implements the authentication logic and returns authorization policies\.

Public key  
The public key from a key pair that is used to prevent unauthorized calls to the authorizer's Lambda function\.  
Use the following command to generate a key pair:  
openssl genrsa \-out myKeyPair\.pem 2048  
Use the following command to extract the public key from the key pair:  
openssl rsa \-in myKeyPair\.pem \-pubout > mykey\.pub

Token key name  
The key name used to extract tokens from the WebSocket connection headers\.

The logic that performs the authentication is implemented in a Lambda function\.

**Note**  
You are charged based on the number of requests for your Lambda functions and the duration, the time it takes for your code to execute\. For more information about AWS Lambda, see [AWS Lambda Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/) and [AWS Lambda Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/)\.

This function takes a token presented by a client or device, authenticates the device, and returns the following information:

isAuthenticated  
A Boolean value that indicates whether the token was authenticated\. If this is `false`, the rest of the response fields should be ignored\. 

principalId  
The ID of the principal that is granted the permissions described in `policyDocuments`\.

policyDocuments  
A list of JSON formatted policy documents following the same conventions as an AWS IoT policy\. The list contains at most 10 policy documents, each of which can be a maximum of 2,048 characters\. 

DisconnectAfterInSecs  
The maximum duration \(in seconds\) of the connection to the AWS IoT gateway, after which it is disconnected\. The minimum value is 300 seconds, and the maximum value is 86,400 seconds\. 

RefreshAfterInSecs  
The period between policy refreshes\. When it lapses, the AWS policy engine reevaluates the policy documents and the AWS IoT Device Gateway invokes the Lambda function again to allow for policy changes\. The minimum value is 300 seconds, and the maximum value is 86,400 seconds\.

Context  
Information derived after validating the token that is made available in [AWS IoT rules engine SQL statements](iot-substitution-templates.md) and [IAM/AWS IoT policy variables](iot-policy-variables.md)\. 

You must grant permission to the AWS IoT service principal to invoke the Lambda function that implements the custom authentication/authorization logic\. You can do this with the following AWS CLI command:

aws lambda add\-permission \-\-function\-name *lambda\_function\_name* \-\-statement\-id *unique\_identifier\_string* \-\-action 'lambda:InvokeFunction' \-\-principal iot\.amazonaws\.com \-\-source\-arn arn:aws:iot:*your\-aws\-region*:*account\_id*: authorizer/*authorizer\-name*

The add\-permission command takes the following parameters:

`function-name`  
The name of the Lambda function to which you are granting invocation permission\.

`statement-id`  
A statement identifier\.

`action`  
The Lambda action you are granting permission to perform\.

`principal`  
The principal to which you are granting permission\.

`source-arn`  
The ARN of the custom authorizer\. Specifying this value ensures your Lambda function can be invoked only by the intended custom authorizer\.

For more information about granting permission to call Lambda functions, see [AWS Lambda Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#intro-permission-model-access-policy)\.

You can set a default authorizer that is used when authorizer information is not included in a connection request:

aws iot set\-default\-authorizer \-\-authorizer\-name *my\-authorizer*
